Nightmare was one of the kindest beings in the multiverse at the time. He cared about everyone and loved all. He had a deep love for flowers (mostly roses) and animals. He had great charity, which could have been part of his downfall, because of how much he gave to others. Nightmare would do anything to protect his brother Dream. When he was younger, he had white bones and was not gooey. His pupils were lavender, and he had no tentacles. He wore a jacket similar to his brother's, only it had long sleeves and was dark purple. It was closed with a gold belt with "NM" on it. He wore black pants and dark purple boots. Atop his head was a golden headpiece with a crescent moon on it.  
 Negative Aura: His Aura brings out despair and Hatred out of those that surrounds him.
